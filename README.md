I'm aiming to revise/ learn all the common questions asked in coding interviews. I've compiled a basic list of the concepts I need to cover, which I will then work through.

# Computer Science Foundations

## Algorithm Complexity
* ~~Big O Notation (time and space)~~

## Trees
* Binary Search Tree (BST)
* Trie
* Balanced (Red Black / AVL)
* Heap
* Traversal (BFS, DFS, in/pre/postorder)

## Graphs
* Graph Representations (objects and pointers, matrix, adjacency list)
* Graph traversal (BFS, DFS)
* Graph colouring
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* A*

## Hash Tables
* Using Java HashMap
* Implementing hashmap with custom hash function

## Sorting
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

## NP-Complete Problems
* Travelling salesman
* Graph colouring problem

## Dynamic Programming
* Rod cutting problem
* Knapsack problem

## Greedy Algorithms
* Huffman Coding
* Kruskal's Algorithm

## Math
* Combinatorics
* Probability


# Practice Problems
* Interpreter for stack based language
* LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with a max capacity, with LRU element replaced when capacity reached
* Given an array of integers, determine if there are 3 elements that sum to 0. Generalise to k elements summing to i.
* Given an integer, replace its bits starting from the bit at position a to the bit at position b, inclusive, with the bits of integer k. Count from the least significant bit to the most significant bit, starting from 0.
For n=24, a=1, b=6, k=17, the output should be 1058. n=100 0000 0000, k=1 0001, 1058=100 0010 0010
* Implement a simple, persistent, thread-safe cache, which should ideally be able to store up to 1 million product names
* Sort the letters in one word by the order they appear in another in linear time
* Given an array of values, design an algorithm that returns whether there are two duplicated within k indices of each other. Do all in O(n) running time and O(k) space
* Implement a multi-map in Java without using an collections
