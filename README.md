I'm aiming to revise/ learn all the common questions asked in coding interviews. I've compiled a basic list of the concepts I need to cover, which I will then work through.

# Computer Science Foundations

## Algorithm Complexity
* ~~Big O Notation (time and space)~~

## Trees
* ~~Binary Search Tree (BST)~~
* ~~Trie~~
* ~~Balanced (Red Black / AVL)~~
* ~~Heap~~
* ~~Traversal (BFS, DFS, in/pre/postorder)~~

## Graphs
* ~~Graph Representations~~
* ~~Graph traversal (BFS, DFS)~~
* Graph colouring
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* A*

## Hashmaps
* Using Java HashMap
* Uses for hashmaps

## Sorting
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

## NP-Complete Problems
* Travelling salesman

## Dynamic Programming
* Rod cutting problem
* Knapsack problem

## Greedy Algorithms
* Huffman Coding
* Kruskal's Algorithm

## Math
* Combinatorics
* Probability


# Practice Problems
1. Interpreter for stack based language
2. LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with a max capacity, with LRU element replaced when capacity reached
3. Given an array of integers, determine if there are 3 elements that sum to 0. Generalise to k elements summing to i.
4. Given an integer, replace its bits starting from the bit at position a to the bit at position b, inclusive, with the bits of integer k. Count from the least significant bit to the most significant bit, starting from 0.
For n=24, a=1, b=6, k=17, the output should be 1058. n=100 0000 0000, k=1 0001, 1058=100 0010 0010
5. Implement a simple, persistent, thread-safe cache, which should ideally be able to store up to 1 million product names
6. ~~Sort the letters in one word by the order they appear in another in linear time~~
7. Given an array of values, design an algorithm that returns whether there are two duplicated within k indices of each other. Do all in O(n) running time and O(k) space
8. Implement a multi-map in Java without using an collections
9. ~~(EASY) Find the first recurring character in a string~~
